# MuExporter
MuExporter is a Balatro mod that exports data from modded content and prepares it to be useable on the [Modded Balatro Wiki](//balatromods.miraheze.org), streamlining the process of adding initial data to the wiki before in-depth documentation begins. It is intended to be easily expanded to atypical item types and cater to each item type's unique quirks that prevent an all-encompassing solution from being developed.

This mod was inspired by pre-existing data extractors such as [CardExporter](//github.com/lshtech/CardExporter) (particularly [Mysthaps's fork](//github.com/Mysthaps/CardExporter)) and [BalatroDumper](//github.com/BakersDozenBagels/BalatroDumper).
